# Go-Server
Welcome to Go (Golang) server implementation. This project aims to provide a robust foundation for building scalable and efficient server-side applications in Go.

Key Features:

Concurrency: Leverage Go's powerful concurrency model for handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.
Routing: Simple and flexible routing for defining API endpoints and handling HTTP requests with ease.
Middleware: Easily plug in middleware for features like logging, authentication, and more.
Performance: Optimize your server for speed with GoServer's performance-focused design.
Modular Design: Build modular and maintainable code with a well-organized project structure.
